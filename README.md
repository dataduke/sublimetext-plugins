Installation
------------
The plugins are available through [Sublime Package Contol](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). If you have not done this yet, follow [these instructions](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation) to install Package Control.


### Prepare Sublime Text 3

This repo provides a repository.json, which points to the latest releases. Open the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows) and choose `Package Control: Add repository`. Enter following url:

```
https://raw.github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-plugins/master/repository.json
```

### Prepare Sublime Text 2

Our plugins reside at their own repos, so you have to add the URLs manually:

* Click on **Preferences > Package Settings > Package Control > Settings - User**.
* Edit and add the following key/value-pairs to that **json** file:

```js
{   
    // Automatically install updates to previsouly installed packages. Default is true.
    
    // "auto_upgrade": false,
    
    
    // Check for fresh versions of plugins after every restart of Sublime Text.
    
    // "auto_upgrade_frequency": 0,
    
    
    // Add the ePages-rnd repositories to your list of repositories.
    
    "package_name_map": {
        "sublimetext-epages-flakes": "Flakes",
        "sublimetext-quickcvs": "QuickCVS"
    },
    "repositories": [
        "https://github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-quickcvs",
        "https://github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-epages-flakes/"
    ]
}
```

* Save the file and restart Sublime.

### Install

Now you can install the plugins:

* Bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). 
* Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list. 
* Then select [Flakes](https://github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-epages-flakes) when the list appears.
* Repeat for [QuickCVS](https://github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-quickcvs). 

The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep the plugins up to date with the latest version.

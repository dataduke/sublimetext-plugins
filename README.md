Installation
------------
The plugins are available through [Sublime Package Contol](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control). Each plugin has its own repo. This repo is only the interface, which gathers the plugins in place.

So you have to install Package Control first, if you haven't done this yet:

* Click the **View > Show Console** menu entry.
* Copy and paste following right into the console:

```import urllib2,os; pf='Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp=sublime.installed_packages_path(); os.makedirs(ipp) if not os.path.exists(ipp) else None; urllib2.install_opener(urllib2.build_opener(urllib2.ProxyHandler())); open(os.path.join(ipp,pf),'wb').write(urllib2.urlopen('http://sublime.wbond.net/'+pf.replace(' ','%20')).read()); print('Please restart Sublime Text to finish installation')```

* Hit return.
* Restart Sublime Text 2.

Our plugin resides at this repo, so you have to add the URL manually:

* Click on **Preferences > Package Settings > Package Control > Settings - User**.
* Edit and add the following key/value-pairs to that **json** file:

```js
{   
    // Check for fresh versions of plugins after every restart of Sublime Text.
    
    // "auto_upgrade_frequency": 0,
    
    
    // Add the ePages-rnd repositories to your list of repositories.
    
    "package_name_map": {
        "sublimetext-epages-flakes": "Flakes",
        "sublimetext-quickcvs": "QuickCVS"
    },
    "repositories": [
        "https://github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-quickcvs",
        "https://github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-epages-flakes/"
    ]
}
```

* Save the file and restart Sublime.

Now you can install the plugins:

* Bring up the Command Palette (`Command+Shift+P` on OS X, `Control+Shift+P` on Linux/Windows). 
* Select "Package Control: Install Package", wait while Package Control fetches the latest package list. 
* Then select [Flakes](https://github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-epages-flakes) when the list appears.
* Repeat for [QuickCVS](https://github.com/ePages-rnd/sublimetext-quickcvs). 

The advantage of using this method is that Package Control will automatically keep the plugins up to date with the latest version.
